        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spaghetti is a popular type of pasta that originated in Italy and has become a beloved dish worldwide. It is made from durum wheat semolina and water, giving it a firm and chewy texture when cooked. Spaghetti is typically long, thin cylindrical strands, though variations like spaghetti alla chitarra are square-shaped.</p>
        <p>Spaghetti is commonly served with a variety of sauces, such as marinara (tomato-based), Bolognese (meat-based), carbonara (egg, cheese, and bacon), or aglio e olio (garlic and oil). It is often boiled in salted water until al dente, meaning it is still slightly firm to the bite, and then tossed with the desired sauce and ingredients.</p>
        <p>Spaghetti is versatile and can be paired with many ingredients, including vegetables, seafood, meats, and cheese. It is a simple yet satisfying dish that is enjoyed by people of all ages and is often served as a main course in Italian cuisine.</p>
